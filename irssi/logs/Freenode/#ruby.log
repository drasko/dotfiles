23:27       definity_ : whops sorry
23:27 :: Irssi: Join to #ruby was synced in 20 secs
23:27        wasamasa : definity_: ruby is that nice and let's you choose the name of the variable(s) your block is using
23:27        wasamasa : definity_: this is done by that rather peculiar syntax
23:28       definity_ : The only thing I can really relate to ruby is perl, and it is rather diffrent so some of the ideas have thrown me a bit
23:28        wasamasa : >> {a: 1, b: 2}.map { |k, v| [v, k] }.to_h
23:28       eval-in__ : wasamasa => {1=>:a, 2=>:b} (https://eval.in/209043)

23:36         apeiros : a "nested" method will simply become defined at the same level as the outer method when the outer method is called
23:36 :: Irssi: Join to #ruby was synced in 20 secs
23:37           jhass : in other words the def keyword changes self but not the definee
23:37         apeiros : and with the same visibility
23:38 theotherstupidg : apeiros, jhass, awesome to knw, but how i can manipulate this and get somthing like level_d work as an alias for level_b, etc.
